## Project Overview
This project uses SQL queries to extract, clean, and analyze data from the European Soccer Database, aiming to deliver actionable insights for a sports channel's content strategy.

### Business Problem
A leading sports channel seeks to enhance its soccer coverage by offering engaging, data-driven content and in-depth analysis. Leveraging historical data from the European Soccer Database will help uncover patterns, performance metrics, and insights that inform both editorial decisions and audience engagement strategies.

### The Data Source and Data Exploration
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's European Soccer Database, consisting of six key tables: :

Country - Country names.

Matches – Results, team stats

Teams – Information on clubs

Players – Player statistics, attributes, and career history

Leagues –  league's names

Team_Attributes – Performance metrics of teams

Player_Attributes – Player skills and ratings

### Data Analysis
Data only speaks when asked the right questions. To turn raw data into actionable insights, I focused on addressing the following business-driven questions:

How many teams are there in each country?

How many matches were played in each league?

Which teams belong to each league?

Who are the top ten teams by performance over multiple seasons?

Who are the top ten players in Europe over the period?

Which season can be considered a "trend season"?

What are the total home goals scored, grouped by country and team?

How many goals did each team score, grouped by season?

How do leagues differ in terms of average goals per match?

How many total goals were scored by home and away teams, grouped by country and season?

What were the win percentages and aggregated win/loss records, along with goals scored and conceded per team, per season?

Which teams had the most wins across all seasons and leagues?

Which team attributes have the biggest impact on total goals scored?

How did the aggregated goals for the top five scoring teams in Spain's La Liga evolve over time?

The total and average number of goals per league in 2011/2012 Season?how many goals were scored in each match in 2011/2012, and how did that compare to the average

Average number of goals scored in match across all seasons?

Average Goals per Match by Country (2008/2009 Season) ?

What is the average number of goals scored in each country across all match seasons ?

Country's average goals differ from the over all avarage?

How does each month's total goals differ from the monthly average of goals scored?

Matches with10 goals ?

Which match stages, where the stakes get higher in each stage, tend to have a higher than average number of goals scored on season 2013/2014 ?

Did a player's BMI influence their performance score (overall rating)?
